			<h2>Enter a URL</h2>
			<p>If you're mapping a website that's already online, making your Web Site Map is as easy as entering or pasting
				the URL into the <b>Website</b> bar in <b>SmartPanel</b>.
				Click <b>Go</b> and wait a few moments while SmartDraw does all the work!</p>
				<div align="center"><img src="../Content/images/IndexWebsite.gif" border="0" alt=""></div><br>
			<h2>Manually Build a Website Map</h2>
			<p>If you're building a map for a web site that has not been posted yet, you can use the <b>Build</b> group in
				SmartPanel, beginning with adding a <b>Home Page</b>.  You can then add child pages to any selected shape
				by clicking the shape and clicking <b>Add Child Page</b>. SmartDraw automatically formats the shapes for
				you.</p>
				<div align="center"><img src="../Content/images/AddLinks.gif" border="0" alt=""></div><br>
			<h2>Delete a Shape</h2>
			<p>You can delete any shape you’d like by selecting it and clicking <b>Delete Selected Page</b> in <b>SmartPanel</b>.
				<i>Be careful:</i> any subordinate shapes (child pages) of the shape you delete are deleted as well.</p>
			<h2>Show or Hide Redundant Links</h2>
			<p>If a link appears in several places on your map, you can check or uncheck <b>Show Redundant Links</b> in the
				<b>Options</b> group of <b>SmartPanel</b> to hide or reveal the repetitions.</p>
				<div align="center"><img src="../Content/images/WebMapOptions.gif" border="0" alt=""></div><br>
			<h2>Get Screenshots or Page Titles</h2>
			<p>Each shape on your Web Site Map includes an image and a link.  You can get the title and a screenshot of each
				page by selecting a shape or several shapes (<a href="../Content/select.htm">How?</a>) and clicking
				<b>Get Page Title</b> or <b>Get Screenshots</b> in <b>SmartPanel</b>.  SmartDraw will go to each page and
				acquire the requested information, replacing the image and/or link in each selected box.</p>
